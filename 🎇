I have become the face of infantry
in this life-long deployment of trench warfare
my ramparts are fortified with every smile and "I'm doing fine".
The demons inside bayonet my memories and the blood of heartbreak past stains my palisades
Vulnerability is the fog that creeps through the maze
polluting my line of sight and clouding my judgment.
Trust launches a napalm strike at the trenches I've dug myself six feet deep
but I've decided to make rock bottom the solid foundation on which I rebuild my life.
